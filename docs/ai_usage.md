I used AI (ChatGPT, Gemini) as a learning aid while working through the Rosalind bioinformatics problems. It helped me understand the problem requirements more clearly and guided me in structuring my Python solutions step by step.

AI provided useful explanations of Biopython functions such as Seq, gc_fraction, and parse, and showed how to properly handle FASTA files and sequence inputs. It also suggested simplified versions of the code when possible, which improved my understanding of different approaches.

I relied on AI support mainly for debugging errors, such as handling uppercase versus lowercase inputs, fixing file-related issues like FileNotFoundError, and ensuring output formats matched Rosalind requirements.

While AI was helpful in clarifying concepts and suggesting code, I always tested and verified the results independently. This allowed me to not only solve the problems correctly but also strengthen my own understanding of the logic behind each task.
